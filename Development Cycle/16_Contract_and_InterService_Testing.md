@copilot If this PR modifies a service API or consumer, implement or update contract tests using a contract-testing framework (e.g., Pact). Verify that the provider and consumer agree on request and response formats. Update API documentation accordingly. Add tests to the CI pipeline that run these contract tests. Ensure backward compatibility unless a breaking change has been agreed upon and documented.
