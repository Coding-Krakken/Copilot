@copilot Review and update the CI/CD pipeline. Ensure that it runs all builds, linters, type checks, unit tests, integration tests, end‑to‑end tests, coverage analysis, security scans, and contract tests on every push or PR. Use caching to speed up builds, and ensure that secrets and configurations are injected securely. Validate that the pipeline produces a single deployment artifact and publishes it to the correct artifact repository. Update pipeline documentation and verify reliability through test runs.
