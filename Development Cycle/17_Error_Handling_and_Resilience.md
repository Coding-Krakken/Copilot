@copilot Implement robust error handling for code introduced in this PR. Use try/catch or errorâ€‘handling constructs to catch exceptions and handle them gracefully. Avoid silently swallowing errors; log them with enough context and propagate when necessary. Implement retries with exponential backoff for transient failures. Add tests to ensure that failures are handled and logged correctly. Consider fallback strategies or circuit breakers if appropriate.
