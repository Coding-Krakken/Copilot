@copilot Rewrite all commits in this PR to follow the Conventional Commit format. Each message should specify the type (e.g., fix, feat, docs), the scope or module, and a concise description of the change, focusing on the “why” rather than the “what.” For example: feat(auth): add JWT token refresh handling. Additionally, generate a PR summary: outline the objective, key changes, modules touched, new tests added, performance impacts, security considerations, and any documentation updates. Provide suggested review comments with file and line references.
