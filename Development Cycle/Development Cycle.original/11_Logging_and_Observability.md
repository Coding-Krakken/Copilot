@copilot Integrate structured logging, metrics, and tracing into the code introduced in this PR. Use the projectâ€™s logging framework and avoid logging sensitive data. Add metrics for key operations (e.g., counters, histograms) and traces for distributed operations. Document new log fields and metrics in the observability documentation. Write tests (or integration checks) to verify that logs and metrics are emitted correctly.
