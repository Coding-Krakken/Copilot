@copilot Ensure the build process produces a single, immutable artifact that can be promoted through all environments. Externalize all environmentâ€‘specific configuration (DB strings, API endpoints) into environment variables or configuration files. Update the CI pipeline definition so it runs build, lint, type checks, tests (unit, integration, E2E), coverage analysis, and security scans on every commit. Commit pipeline files to version control.
