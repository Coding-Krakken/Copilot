@copilot Harden the code in this PR: validate all inputs, sanitize outputs, encode user‑supplied data, and handle exceptions gracefully. Remove hard‑coded secrets or credentials and replace them with environment variables or secret manager references. Integrate static and dynamic security scanning (SAST/DAST/SCA) into the CI pipeline. Add negative tests for injection and boundary cases, and fix any discovered vulnerabilities.
