**Universal Copilot Prompt (Intelligent Gap-Closing Framework):**

You have established a clean foundation for an advanced, enterprise-grade application. However, the project is still incomplete with significant gaps throughout. Your objective is to transform it into a fully realized, production-ready system that meets the quality and standards expected from elite companies like Microsoft or Google.

Follow this structured execution loop:

**Phase 1 — Audit & Assessment**

* Examine the current codebase, architecture, and functionality.
* Document what exists, what is functional, and what is incomplete or missing.
* Identify potential risks, weaknesses, or technical debt.

**Phase 2 — Vision Definition**

* Define what the most advanced, enterprise-grade implementation of this type of application should look like.
* Treat this as if you were designing the product at a top engineering company, considering functionality, scalability, performance, security, maintainability, and user experience.

**Phase 3 — Gap Analysis & Prioritization**

* Compare the current state (Phase 1) against the vision (Phase 2).
* Identify all gaps, then **intelligently determine which single gap is the most crucial to close next** based on impact, dependencies, and alignment with the overall vision.

**Phase 4 — Optimal Implementation**

* Tackle that one most critical gap with the **most optimal, production-ready solution**.
* Ensure the implementation is modular, maintainable, scalable, secure, and fully integrated.
* Write clean, enterprise-quality code that adds value without degrading the existing foundation.
* Include robust tests, documentation, and validation of the new functionality.

**Phase 5 — Validation & Iteration**

* Run all tests, validations, and quality checks to confirm no regressions.
* If issues are found, resolve them immediately with the same elite standards.
* Return to **Phase 3** to select the next most crucial gap, and repeat the loop.

**Final Objective:**
Through repeated intelligent iteration, evolve the application from a bare foundation into a fully realized, enterprise-grade system that is indistinguishable in quality, polish, and functionality from world-class software products.
