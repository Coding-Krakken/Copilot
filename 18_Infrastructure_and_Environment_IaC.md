@copilot If this PR requires infrastructure or configuration changes, update the Infrastructure‑as‑Code files (e.g., Terraform, CloudFormation) and version them alongside application code. Externalize secrets and configurations into a secure secrets manager and reference them in code via environment variables. Provide a safe deployment plan for these changes and update any automation scripts accordingly. Add infrastructure tests (or compliance checks) to the CI pipeline.
