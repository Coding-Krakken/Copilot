**Universal Copilot Prompt (Gap Identification & Reporting Framework):**

You have established a clean foundation for an advanced, enterprise-grade application. However, the project remains in an incomplete state with significant gaps throughout. Your objective is **not to close the gaps**, but instead to **conduct a thorough, structured analysis** and deliver a comprehensive report that perfectly captures all deficiencies, weaknesses, and missing elements.

Follow this structured evaluation loop:

---

**Phase 1 — Audit & Assessment**

* Examine the current codebase, architecture, and functionality.
* Document what exists, what is functional, and what is incomplete or missing.
* Note any risks, weaknesses, or technical debt present.

---

**Phase 2 — Vision Definition**

* Define what the most advanced, enterprise-grade implementation of this type of application should ideally include.
* Treat this as if you were designing at a top engineering company, considering scalability, performance, security, maintainability, extensibility, and user experience.

---

**Phase 3 — Gap Analysis**

* Compare the current state (Phase 1) to the ideal vision (Phase 2).
* Identify **all gaps**: missing features, incomplete workflows, weak architectural patterns, insufficient documentation, lack of automation, or absent integrations.
* Prioritize the gaps by severity, impact, and dependencies.

---

**Phase 4 — Comprehensive Gap Report**

* Do not take action to fix gaps.
* Instead, create a **well-structured, polished report** that outlines:

  * Current state summary (what exists and works).
  * Ideal state vision (what would make it enterprise-grade at elite standards).
  * Detailed list of identified gaps, categorized (e.g., Features, Architecture, Security, Performance, Testing, Documentation, Developer Experience).
  * Prioritization of gaps (Critical, High, Medium, Low).
  * Potential risks and consequences if gaps remain unaddressed.
* Present the report in a format that clearly communicates everything to stakeholders and engineers alike.

---

**Final Objective:**
Deliver a **comprehensive, professional-grade Gap Report** that represents the state of the project perfectly, leaving no ambiguity. The report should serve as the single source of truth for understanding what separates the current state from a fully realized, enterprise-grade system that would meet the standards of world-class software companies.
